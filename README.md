# Mine Sweeper
This is a minesweeper game written by python (pygame).

It's a reproduction of classic game in windows. 

I implemented the following features:

* show the number of left mines
* user can label the mine by clicking right button
* user can discover a block by clicking left button and show the result
* when the game is over (no matter win or lose), user can restart a new game by clicking the head portrait of Fox Ali.

(I must commit I'm not good at playing it, so I just set the total mines as 5! Easy and Peace!)

Future work:

* User can change the number of total mines. Right now it can only be changed by modifying in the code.
* User can change the size of minesweeper. In this version, I just fix the size as $9*9$ matrix. In the future version, it can allow user to define the size.
* Add and show a timer.
